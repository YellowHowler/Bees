        Hello! My name is Ritta Choi, and I am a passionate game 
        developer. I mostly focus on developing casual, sandbox 
        games in Unity, but I am flexible with developing in any 
        genre. My primary focus is software programming; I am skillful 
        and familiar with Python, Java, and C#, and I know basic HTML.
        I also often design games, having fundamental knowledge 
        of Photoshop, Illustrator, Clip Studio Paint, and Aseprite. 

        I love animals, so my works usually feature animals. I am 
        especially interested in bees, cats, and dragons.
